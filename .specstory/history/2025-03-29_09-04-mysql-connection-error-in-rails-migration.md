# MySQL Connection Error in Rails Migration (2025-03-29 18:04:48)

I notice you've shared an error message from a Rails database migration attempt, but I don't see an actual question in your query. The error shows that there's a MySQL connection issue where the host '172.25.0.4' is not allowed to connect to the MySQL server.

Would you like help with:
1. Resolving this MySQL connection issue?
2. Understanding why this error occurs?
3. Something else related to Rails database configuration?

Please let me know what specific assistance you need, and I'll be happy to help you resolve the issue.
